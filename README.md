# Bettersearch
Easy way to search only through selected website. https://ajvejko.github.io/bettersearch/
Using googles feature like site:"siteName" to get search results from only selected websites or directly using sites search engine.

- Project started on Vanilla JS and is my first project and is planned to be maintained and updated later to React and TypeScript as I personally use this as a replacement to the Home Screen. FireFox currently does not allow custom sites on new tab and I am using an extension for that, but later will write my own.

Currently working on:
Custom Shortcuts and Search websites. (You can see "Add Button"(+), but not functional yet).

TO-DO:
Custom Shortcuts and Search websites (WIP), <br />
Custom Background Option, <br />
Custom Highlight Color, <br />
Custom button Color, <br />
Make borders look closer to excalidraw, currently only font, <br />
New-Tab extension <br />
Option to either keep or close current TAB on Search <br />
